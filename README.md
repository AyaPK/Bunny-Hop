## A game made for the GMTK Game Jam 2025


### Theme: Loop

## Description
Bunny Hop is a fast paced puzzle-platformer with tight controls and an emphasis on speed management.
Inspired by bunnyhopping in FPS games, Bunny must build speed and try to keep it through a series of levels, with a speed requirement at the goal.
Didn't have enough speed? No problem, you'll loop back to the start of the level, keeping your speed, so you can try again!
